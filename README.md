# 👋 Hi, I'm Teddy

I'm a software engineer based in San Francisco, California, with a passion for building clean, efficient, and user-focused web applications. I specialize in front-end development with **ReactJS** and full-stack development using **Python and Django**. Whether it’s crafting seamless user interfaces or developing scalable backend systems, I love turning ideas into working products.

## 🛠 What I Do

My work centers on designing interactive, high-performance web apps with modern JavaScript frameworks—primarily React—and building robust, secure APIs and services using Django. I enjoy working across the full stack and am always looking for elegant solutions to complex problems.

I’m especially drawn to projects that involve:
- Learning platforms and education tech
- Developer tools and productivity apps
- API design and backend architecture
- Clean UI/UX implementation

## 🚀 Current Focus

Lately, I’ve been working on a Django-based learning platform that uses AI to generate personalized learning paths. The project integrates CrewAI agents and modern frontend tools to create a dynamic, interactive experience for users looking to master new skills.

I'm also exploring:
- AI-assisted learning experiences
- Django + React integrations
- PostgreSQL performance tuning
- Open-source contributions

## 🌱 Outside of Coding

Outside of development, I enjoy staying active, exploring the Bay Area, and keeping up with new trends in tech, especially in AI, developer tooling, and web frameworks. I'm a big believer in lifelong learning and love helping others grow their skills through technology.

I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects or chatting about ideas. Feel free to explore my repositories, fork a project, or reach out!
